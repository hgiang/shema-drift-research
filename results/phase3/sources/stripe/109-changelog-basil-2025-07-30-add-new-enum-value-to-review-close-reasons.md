# Adds a new value to payment review closed reasons

## What’s new

Introduces `payment_never_settled` and `acknowledged` as new enum values of the `Review` object’s [closed_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews/object.md?api-version=preview#review_object-closed_reason). The `payment_never_settled` value provides a more detailed reason to specify when the issuer bank declines the transaction that triggers automatic closure of the review. The `acknowledged` value provides the reason to specify a user reviewed and closed the payment review.

## Why is this a breaking change?

Adding the new enum values is considered a breaking change because existing user integrations might not anticipate or handle the new values correctly. This can lead to unexpected behaviour, errors, or failures in systems that rely on explicitly handling known enum cases.

## Impact

Closed payment reviews now include the new `payment_never_settled` value as a `closed_reason`. Update your integration to handle this value accordingly.
